The backend service will use the same ConfigMap as the other apps, but it also has additional configuration specified in the application-specific file.
Take a moment to review this file.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/config-files/blueorgreen.yml
```

These configurations will cause each app to start on a different port.
On Kubernetes, this is not necessary, and in fact would only complicate configuration management.
You can remove the `server.port` settings from this file, or you can set the ports to `8080` on Kubernetes.
The latter approach maintains back-compatibility with non-cloud deployments.

Add configuration to set the port to 8080 on Kubernetes:
```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/color-app/config-files/blueorgreen.yml
text: |
        ---
        spring:
          config:
            activate:
              on-cloud-platform: "kubernetes"
        server:
          port: 8080
```

Creating a ConfigMap from `blueorgreen.yml`.
```execute-1
kubectl create configmap blueorgreen-config \
        --from-file=application-blueorgreen.yml=config-files/blueorgreen.yml \
        -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/blueorgreen-configmap.yaml
```

Review the resulting file.
```execute-1
cat k8s/blueorgreen-configmap.yaml
```

Add both ConfigMaps using a Volume in the backend service manifest template.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          projected:
            sources:
            - configMap:
                name: application-config
            - configMap:
                name: blueorgreen-config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```
