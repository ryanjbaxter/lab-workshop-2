## Templating The `bluegreenservice` Deployment

The file `blueorgreen-deployment.template` will act as a template we can use to create deployment manifests for the various Color Apps.
We need to template this deployment manifest in two places:

1. The name of the deployment
2. The Spring Boot profile we want to activate

Execute the following `sed` command to replace the `metadata.name` property
in the manifest with the template `$COLOR`.

```execute-1
sed -i '0,/name: blueorgreen/{s/name: blueorgreen/name: $COLOR/}' k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
```

To activate the Spring Boot profile for the color we can set the environment
variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` in the container when it starts on Kubernetes.
> Note: Notice that we are adding `blueorgreen` as an additional profile.
> This will enable Spring Boot to automatically use a properties file called application-blueorgreen.yml.
> We will use this naming convention when we mount `config-files/blueorgreen.yml`.

Add the following templated environment variable to the manifest to set the active profiles.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.spec.containers[0]
value:
    env:
    - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
      value: blueorgreen,$COLOR
```

In addition, we are going to add a label to our deployments called `hint` indicating whether a service is a premium service or not.
This will allow our Kubernetes service definition that we will create in the next section to select the appropriate services.
This will also need to be templated depending on the `blueorgreen` service we are deploying.

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: metadata.labels
value:
    hint: $TYPE
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.selector.matchLabels
value:
    hint: $TYPE
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template
path: spec.template.metadata.labels
value:
    hint: $TYPE
```

Now we can substitute the variables in this template using the `envsubst` command line
utility and generate deployment manifests for each of the Color Apps.

```execute-1
COLOR=blue
TYPE=nonpremium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/blue-deployment.yaml

COLOR=green
TYPE=nonpremium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/green-deployment.yaml

COLOR=yellow
TYPE=premium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/yellow-deployment.yaml

COLOR=slowgreen
TYPE=nonpremium
export COLOR
export TYPE
envsubst < k8s/blueorgreen-deployment.template > k8s/slowgreen-deployment.yaml
```

Take a moment to review one of the files created.
```editor:open-file
file: ~/color-app/k8s/blue-deployment.yaml
```
