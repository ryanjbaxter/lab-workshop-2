Spring Cloud provides nice abstractions around things like load balancing, service discovery, and configuration that allows you to run your applications on multiple cloud platforms with little to no changes of the code base.
If however you have determined you only want to deploy your applications to Kubernetes and don't want or need the abstractions you can rely on the cloud native features of Kubernetes directly in which case you can remove Spring Cloud Kubernetes from the applications.

### Remove The Spring Cloud Kubernetes Dependencies


Execute the following `sed` commands to remove the Spring Cloud Kubernetes dependencies from the application POM files.

```execute-1
sed -i '29,36d' ~/color-app/authgateway/pom.xml
sed -i '29,36d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/pom.xml
sed -i '29,36d' ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/pom.xml
```
