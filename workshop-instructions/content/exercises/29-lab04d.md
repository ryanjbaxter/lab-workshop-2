You can open the Auth Gateway and test out the premium and non-premium use cases.

Premium username: `premium`
Premium password: `pw`

Non-premium username: `user`
Non-premium password: `pw`

Use the following action button to open the Auth Gateway in your browser.

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}
```

You can use the following action button to log out.

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}/logout
```

If you refresh the app in your browser you will likely see the same color returned every time you refresh.

Load balancing is very "sticky" with Kubernetes services.
If you make a lot of requests, you will eventually notice the load balancing.
An easy way to demonstrate this is to run a script that generates many requests.
You can execute this script within a pod on Kubernetes.

Execute the following command to run a pod that will open a `bash` terminal allowing you to run some commands inside the pod.

```execute-2
kubectl run --rm utils -it --image yenigul/dockernettools bash
```

After a few moments, you should see the following output in Terminal 2:
```
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
bash-5.0$ 
```

Once you see the `bash` prompt, run the following command to make several hundred requests to the Routing Gateway.
Observe the colors returned.

 ```execute-2
 x=1; while [ $x -le 500 ]; do curl http://blueorgreengateway/blueorgreen; (( x++ )); done
 ```
As this runs, you should see the color change every so often.

Exit the running pod by executing the following command.
 ```execute-2
 exit
 ```
