As you saw in the previous exercise, instances reported a hint to Eureka to indicate if they were `premium` or `nonpremium`, so we had this information on a per-instance basis.
With Kubernetes, we don't have this luxury, the metadata belongs to the `Service` so we can't define it on a per-instance (pod) basis.
Rather, we need to define it on a per-`Service` basis:

Eureka:
- blueorgreen-app
  - blue (hint: nonpremium)
  - green (hint: nonpremium)
  - slowgreen (hint: nonpremium)
  - yellow (hint: premium)

Kubernetes:
- blueorgreen-service (hint: premium or nonpremium?)
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

In order to resolve this, we can create two `Service`s in Kubernetes, one for `premium` (`blueorgreen-premium`) and one for `nonpremium` (`blueorgreen-nonpremium`) users:

- blueorgreen-nonpremium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
- blueorgreen-premium-service
  - blue
  - green
  - slowgreen
  - yellow

This way, we can modify the routing configuration in gateway and if the incoming request belongs to a non-premium user, we can route it to the `blueorgreen-nonpremium` `Service`.
Similarly, if the request belongs to a premium user, we can route it to `blueorgreen-premium`. 
(If you indent the code appropriately in the editor, you will see the diff about the changes.)

Notice the route definition in the Routing Gateway app for routing requests to the color instances:
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: '.route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")'
before: 0
after: 2
```

Replace this route definition with a different definition that distinguishes between premium and non-premium destinations.
First, remove the existing route definition.
```execute-1
sed -i '29,31d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Then paste in the new route definitions.
```editor:insert-lines-before-line
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
line: 29
text: |
                .route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")
                        .and().header("X-SC-LB-Hint", "nonpremium")
                        .filters(this::circuitBreaker)
                        .uri("lb://blueorgreen-nonpremium"))
                .route(p -> p.path("/blueorgreen")
                        .filters(this::circuitBreaker)
                        .uri("lb://blueorgreen-premium"))
```

The Routing Gateway will now be able to route requests appropriately without the help of Eureka hints.
