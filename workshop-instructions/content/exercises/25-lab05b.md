You can open the `authgateway` and test out the premium and non-premium use cases.

Premium username: `premium`
Premium password: `pw`

Non-premium username: `user`
Non-premium password: `pw`

Use the following action button to open the `authgateway`.

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}
```

You can use the following action button to log out.

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}/logout
```

If you refresh the app in your browser you will likely see the same color returned every time you refresh.

Load balancing is very "sticky" with Kubernetes services, however Kubernetes will load balance requests if you make a lot of requests.
The easiest way to show this is to run some scripts in a POD running on Kubernetes. 

Execute the following command to run a POD that will open a `bash` terminal allowing you to run some commands inside a POD.

```execute-2
kubectl run --rm utils -it --image yenigul/dockernettools bash
```

Once you see a `bash` prompt run the following command to make several hundred requests to the `blueorgreengateway` and observe the 
colors returned.

 ```execute-2
 x=1; while [ $x -le 500 ]; do curl http://blueorgreengateway/blueorgreen; (( x++ )); done
 ```
As this runs you should see the color returned change every so often.

You can now exit the running POD by executing the following command.


 ```execute-2
 exit
 ```
