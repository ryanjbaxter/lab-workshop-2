Recall that in the previous step, you added configuration to the common `application.yml` file for Kubernetes deployments.
Review the file now.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/config-files/application.yml
text: "on-cloud-platform"
before: 3
after: 11
```

To maintain this configuration file external to the apps, you can mount it as a ConfigMap.

Create a ConfigMap from the common `application.yml` file.
```execute-1
kubectl create configmap application-config \
        --from-file=config-files/application.yml \
        -o yaml --dry-run=client > k8s/application-configmap.yaml
```

Review the resulting file.
```execute-1
cat k8s/application-configmap.yaml | yq eval
```

Mount the ConfigMap as a container volume mount in each deployment spec.

Start with the Auth Gateway deployment manifest.

First create a volume.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/authgateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: application-config
```

Then, mount the volume on the container.
If you mount the volume at `/workspace/config/`, for example, Spring Boot will find this configuration by default and load it as usual.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/authgateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```

Do the same for the Routing Gateway and Frontend.
```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/gateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: application-config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/gateway-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec
value:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: application-config
```

```editor:insert-value-into-yaml
file: ~/color-app/k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
path: spec.template.spec.containers.[0]
value:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /workspace/config
```
