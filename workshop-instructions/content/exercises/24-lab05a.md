Service resources in Kubernetes provide load balancing across PODs so we can remove the use of Spring Cloud Loadbalancer.

In the `authgateway` application we have a load balanced route.
Use the following action button to view the line where it is used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreengateway"
```

Execute the following command to replace the `lb` protocol with `http`.

```execute-1
sed -i s/lb:/http:/g ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
```

In the `blueorgreenfrontend` application we are using a `@LoadBalanced` `RestTemplate`.
Use the following action button to view the line where it is used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/BlueOrGreenFrontendApplication.java
text: "@LoadBalanced"
```

Execute the following command to remove the `@LoadBalanced` annotation.

```execute-1
sed -i s/@LoadBalanced//g ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/BlueOrGreenFrontendApplication.java
```

In the `blueorgreengateway` application we are again using load balanced routes.
Use the following action buttons to view the lines where they are used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreen-nonpremium"
```

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreen-premium"
```

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreenfrontend"
```

Execute the following command to replace the `lb` protocol with `http`.

```execute-1
sed -i s/lb:/http:/g ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

In addition we have a `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation that we no longer need as well.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "@LoadBalancerClient"
```

Execute the following command to remove the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation.

```execute-1
sed -i '19,19d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
sed -i '9,9d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Since we no longer need any load balancer client configuration we can remove `LoadBalancerConfiguration`.

```execute-1
rm ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/LoadBalancerConfiguration.java
```

Now that we have removed all the code we need we can build images for our applications, push them to the registry and redeploy the applications.

Remove the deployments and services from Kubernetes using the following command.

```execute-1
kubectl delete -Rf ~/color-app/k8s
```
Build new images for the apps using the following command.

```execute-1
cd blueorgreenfrontend/ && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ../
cd blueorgreengateway/ && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ../
cd authgateway/ && ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -D skipTests && cd ../
```

Push the new images to our registry using the following command.

```execute-1
docker tag blueorgreenfrontend:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend

docker tag blueorgreengateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/blueorgreengateway

docker tag authgateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
docker push $REGISTRY_HOST/color-app/authgateway
```

```execute-1
kubectl apply -Rf ~/color-app/k8s
```

To `watch` the deployments happen run the following command

```execute-1
watch -n 1 kubectl get all
```
