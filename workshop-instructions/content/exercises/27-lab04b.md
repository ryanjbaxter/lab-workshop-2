The Frontend, Auth Gateway, and Routing Gateway apps use Spring load balanced routes and Rest templates to load balance requests across endpoints.
On Kubernetes, this is redundant since Kubernetes Services provide load balancing across pods.

The Auth Gateway uses the `lb` protocol.
Use the following action button to view the line where it is used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreengateway"
```

Execute the following command to replace the `lb` protocol with `http`.

```execute-1
sed -i s/lb:/http:/g ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
```

Check the file again to verify that the protocol has been updated.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/authgateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/samples/authgateway/AuthgatewayApplication.java
text: "http://blueorgreengateway"
```

The Frontend uses a `@LoadBalanced` `RestTemplate`.
Use the following action button to view the line where it is used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/BlueOrGreenFrontendApplication.java
text: "@LoadBalanced"
```

Execute the following command to remove the `@LoadBalanced` annotation.

```execute-1
sed -i s/@LoadBalanced//g ~/color-app/blueorgreenfrontend/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/BlueOrGreenFrontendApplication.java
```

Click on the Editor tab again and validate that the annotation was deleted.

The Routing Gateway also uses load balanced routes.
Use the following action buttons to view the lines where they are used.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreen-nonpremium"
```

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreen-premium"
```

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "lb://blueorgreenfrontend"
```

Execute the following command to replace the `lb` protocol with `http`.

```execute-1
sed -i s/lb:/http:/g ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Click on the Editor tab again and validate that the protocol was updated in all three locations.

In addition, Auth Gateway uses a `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation that is no longer needed.

```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
text: "@LoadBalancerClient"
```

Execute the following command to remove the `@LoadBalancerClient` annotation.

```execute-1
sed -i '19,19d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
sed -i '9,9d' ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/BlueorgreengatewayApplication.java
```

Since you no longer need any load balancer client configuration you can also remove the `LoadBalancerConfiguration.java` file entirely.

```execute-1
rm ~/color-app/blueorgreengateway/src/main/java/org/springframework/demo/blueorgreengateway/LoadBalancerConfiguration.java
```
