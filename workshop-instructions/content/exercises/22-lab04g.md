To `watch` the deployments happen run the following command

```execute-2
watch -n 1 kubectl get all
```

To deploy everything to Kubernetes run the following command

```execute-1
kubectl apply -Rf ~/color-app/k8s
```

Click the action button below to open the Auth Gateway in your browser and test the application.
You should be able to log in with the user `user` and the password `pw` and only see the colors blue, green, or red (for the `slowgreen` service.)

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}
```

Now log out by going to

```dashboard:open-url
url: http://blueorgreenauthgateway-{{ session_namespace }}.{{ ingress_domain }}/logout
```

Then log back in with the user `premium` and the password `pw`.
Now in addition to the colors you saw with the user `user` you
should see the color yellow.

Exit the watch command by running the following action command.

```terminal:interrupt
session: 2
```
